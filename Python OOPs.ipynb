    "## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",

    "Ans - Dunder methods in Python are special built-in methods whose names start and end with double underscores. They are also called magic methods. These methods allow classes to behave like built-in types and let you customize how objects respond to operators, functions or built-in behaviors."

    "Ans - Inheritance in OOP means creating a new class using the features of an existing class. The new class (called the child or derived class) automatically gets the properties and methods of the existing class (called the parent or base class). This helps reuse code and avoids writing the same logic again."

    "Ans - Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters. Many languages like Java and C++ support it directly, but Python does not allow true method overloading in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, if you define two methods with the same name in a class, the last one will overwrite the earlier one."

    "Ans - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it makes code flexible, reusable and easier to maintain. It allows one function or method name to work differently based on the object calling it. This means you can write general code that works with many object types instead of rewriting the same logic again."

    "Ans - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to act as a base for other classes. It defines a structure for subclasses and may contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is declared but doesn’t have a complete implementation in the base class."

Python automatically handles memory management, so you rarely need it, but it's useful when you want to clean up resources before the object is removed from memory."

    "Ans - Polymorphism with inheritance in Python works by allowing a child class to override a method from the parent class, and then using the same method name to perform different actions depending on the object calling it. Even though the method name is the same, Python decides which version to run based on the object type."
